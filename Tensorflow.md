# TensorFlow
* Main use in Neural Networks, Classification and Regression

## Neural Network

* ANN

    * Dendrite = Input
    * Neuron = Node (A node can be cpu,gpu,tpu)
    * Axom = Output

```
First Layer == Input Layer where we give input
                We can give any number of neuron in it
                But Recommended is 
number of neuron in input layer == number of attributes 

Next Layers == Hidden Layers

Hidden layers use Activation Functions....
Google recommends use of Activation functions in a particular way... But it is not mandatory.


Cost Function : Error nikalne ka kaam
                Error is calculated by Cost Function
                Actual output and predicted ka difference
                But its formula is quiet complicated


Uses of ANN : 
1. Performance Search
2. Voice Processing
3. Self driving car
4. Computer games


Geoffrey Hinton : Godfather of Deep Learning

Activation Functions : 

1. Threshold
2. Sigmoid      (generally on final layer)
3. Rectifier
4. Hyperbolic tangent


Weight = Actual input mai kuch aisa multiply karo jisse inka value change na ho ...kuch ho bhi to negligible.

Q. who will comapare the multiple predicted output with actual output

Gradient Descent : Method to adjust weights
                    They are of 2 types
                    1. Normal : works on Brute Force
                    2. Stochastic : 

Epoch : When the whole data is processed, then 1 epoch

Batch Size :


```

> If ANN has more than 2 Hidden Layers, Then we call it Deep Neural Network

# Keras

> It is the modified version of tensorflow.

> It is more automated than tensorflow
## Neural Network

* CNN

```
 CNN is the modified version of ANN
 In CNN, all neurons of one layer must connect with all neurons of next hidden layer.

### PowerBI

#### Q. make tensorflow playground
#### Q. make mutual fund example


##  Work with imageAI and YOLO
## use darkflow or darknet for cnn
